# The-Sparks-Heeling-Minds
This initiative aims to provide a website for people looking for online counselling and therapy for conditions like anxiety, depression, etc. People can make an appointment with their doctor using this website. They can monitor the progress of their reservation. They will get an email from the clinic with information about their booking. The patient can select their chosen level of counselling membership (silver, gold, or platinum) and pay accordingly. Patients can ask questions about membership and other issues using the built-in chatbot. There are free webinar sessions where participants can select their preferred category (Adults, Children) as well as their preferred webinar format (live/recorded).
